    "Purpose:\n",
    "The DB_Connection class is designed to handle connections to SQLite databases. It includes methods to create a folder for the database file if it doesn't exist, open a connection to the database, and close the connection. This class facilitates database operations in a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Attributes:\n",
    "db_name: A string representing the name of the database.\n",
    "folder_path: A string representing the path to the folder where the database file is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructor (__init__ method):\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "db_name: The name of the database.\n",
    "folder_path: The path to the folder where the database file is stored.\n",
    "db_path: (Note: db_path is present in the parameter list, but not used in the method. If needed, you may want to use it to construct the full path to the database file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Initializes the object's attributes db_name and folder_path with the provided values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. create_folder method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Checks if the specified folder path exists.\n",
    "If it doesn't exist, creates the folder.\n",
    "Prints a success message if a new folder is created; otherwise, indicates that the folder already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. open_conn method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: db_path: The path to the SQLite database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Attempts to establish a connection to the SQLite database specified by db_path.\n",
    "If successful, prints a success message and returns the connection object.\n",
    "If an error occurs during the connection attempt, prints an error message and aborts the program using sys.exit(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. close_conn method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Attempts to commit any outstanding transactions and close the database connection.\n",
    "Prints success messages for committing transactions and closing the connection.\n",
    "If an exception occurs during the process, prints an error message."

    "Purpose:\n",
    "The provided configuration settings are intended for extracting and storing SEC filing information related to specific companies and filing types. The configuration is designed for obtaining buy reports from the SEC database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration Settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. company_CIKs:\n",
    "Description: A list of Central Index Key (CIK) numbers representing companies for which buy reports will be extracted.\n",
    "Usage: You need to replace the existing CIK number with the CIK number of the specific company you are interested in. You can find CIK numbers on the SEC EDGAR Company Search page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. filing_types:\n",
    "Description: A list of filing types that you want to extract. Use the '10-K', '10-Q', '8-K' format.\n",
    "Usage: Modify the list to include the specific filing types relevant to buy reports. For example, '10-q' is provided as an initial value, but you can add other relevant types such as '10-K'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. db_name:\n",
    "Description: The name of the SQLite database that will be used to store the extracted filing information.\n",
    "Usage: Change the value to the desired name for your database. The script will automatically create the database if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. folder_path:\n",
    "Description: The folder path where the SQLite database file will be stored.\n",
    "Usage: Provide the appropriate folder path where you want the SQLite database file ('edgar.db') to be saved. Ensure that you have write permissions for the specified folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. db_path:\n",
    "Description: The full path to the SQLite database file, combining folder_path and db_name.\n",
    "Usage: The script generates this path automatically based on folder_path and db_name. You don't need to modify this directly unless you want to specify a custom path.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. start_date and end_date:\n",
    "Description: The date range for the filings in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.\n",
    "Usage: Set the appropriate start and end dates to filter filings within the specified date range. Adjust these dates based on your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note:\n",
    "Before running the script, ensure that the specified folder path (folder_path) exists, and you have the necessary write permissions to create the SQLite database file in that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the provided configuration settings according to your specific requirements for extracting buy reports from the SEC database."
