Short-term investing typically refers to holding investments for a period of less than a year, aiming for quick gains. Long-term investing means holding assets for several years, benefiting from compound growth and weathering market volatility. Long-term investing is generally considered less risky over time.

Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, or geographical regions to reduce risk. By diversifying, you reduce the impact of poor performance from a single investment on your overall portfolio.

Compound interest refers to earning interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. In investing, it means that your returns are reinvested, generating more returns over time, leading to exponential growth.

A common recommendation is to invest at least 15-20% of your income, but this can vary depending on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance. It's important to have an emergency fund and manageable debt levels before investing aggressively.

Stocks represent ownership in a company and come with the potential for higher returns but also higher risk. Bonds are loans to corporations or governments with fixed interest payments, offering lower risk but generally lower returns than stocks.

Index funds are mutual funds or ETFs that track a specific market index, like the S&P 500. They are popular due to their low fees, diversification, and passive management, which makes them a solid choice for long-term, hands-off investors.

A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that is paid to shareholders, usually on a quarterly basis. Companies that pay dividends are often more established, and dividends provide investors with a steady income stream, in addition to potential stock price appreciation.

Risk tolerance is your ability and willingness to withstand losses in your investments. It depends on factors like your financial situation, investment timeline, and emotional response to market volatility. Tools like risk questionnaires can help you assess it.

To protect your investments during a downturn, you can diversify your portfolio, include more stable assets like bonds, hold cash reserves, and avoid panic selling. Focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term market fluctuations can also help.

An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) and a 401(k) are both retirement savings accounts. The main difference is that a 401(k) is employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions, while an IRA is an individual account that offers more flexibility in investment choices. Both accounts offer tax advantages.
