**Key Patterns Observed**

- **Clarity and Specificity:** Answers that clearly address the question and provide specific examples or insights generally receive higher scores.
- **Complexity:** While some technical details are necessary, the answers should also cater to a general audience's understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement,** consider adding:
