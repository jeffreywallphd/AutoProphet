# Education-Finance Future Feature Ideas 
 ##### *Currently, the slides implemented into GitHub are very basic. These can be made more interactive and user-friendly to include graphics and so forth.* 

## Future Idea #1: Jeff's Voice for Voiceovers
 ### Currently, the voiceovers are implemented in the voice of a British woman. However, we were initially thinking of using Jeff's voice to do the voiceovers, using an AI voice-generator to replicate it. We used elevenlabs.io in this project, and this can be used to imitate voices as well. We believe this is something future semesters can endeavor to use.

## Future Idea #2: Module Quizzes
 ### Another feature we thought would be useful to include are short module quizzes at the end of each learning section. This would allow users to test their knowledge based on the layout of the slides. These quizzes could be formatted as short multiple-choice questions, or something similar. 

## Future Idea #3:  Demo Account
 ### After completing the modules, we thought it would be interesting to include a demo account or portfolio that would allow users to practice trading on the market with "fake" money. This way they could practice the tips and tricks they learned, and work interactively with the market itself, without worrying about losing their personal money. This could allow users (especially beginners) to become more confident with the market.
