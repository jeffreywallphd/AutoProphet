“The word bond is often used, but what exactly does it mean? A bond is like an “I owe you” between issuers, such as organizations or the government, and investors. When you purchase bonds, you essentially lend your money to the issuer for a specified period. This benefits the issuers because they can use your borrowed money to build their capital. It benefits you as well though! On top of paying back the full amount the issuer borrowed, known as the principal, the issuers also pay interest. We’ll go more into bond interest payments soon! To sum it up, bonds are essentially loans taken out by companies from investors like yourself.”

“Now that we have a foundation of what bonds are, let us start with the qualities of bonds. As mentioned before, the companies have to pay interest on the principal—this is where the concept of nominal value comes into play. The nominal interest payment is called an interest coupon and is calculated as a percentage of the face value of a bond. This is how companies compensate investors for their money.”

“It is important to note that companies pay the interest coupons at predetermined intervals whether that be monthly, annually, or semi-annually. This is to ensure that investors receive continuous income from their investments.”

“Traditionally, bonds are considered to be safer, but they are also more expensive. To make investing more accessible and safe, bond indexing has become a common practice. Bond indexing is when the performance of a specific bond or a group of bonds is tracked and benchmarked. This allows possible investors to see how the bonds are doing in the broader market. These indexes can be used to inform investors of the issuer type, market capitalization, changes in bond prices, and many other pertinent facts about specific bonds and bond groups.”

“When a bond reaches maturity it has essentially reached the end of its lifetime. Said lifetime is predetermined by the type of bond and its issuer. There are short-term bonds that are 1-3 years long, medium-term bonds that are 4-10 years long, and also long-term bonds which are any bond that reaches maturity in a period of over 10 years.”

“At the bond maturity date, the issuer is obligated to repay the investor the full face value otherwise known as the principal amount. Once the bond reaches this point, the issuer is no longer obligated to pay nominal interest on the bond. This is also when the bond ceases to exist. The maturity date strongly impacts a bond's yield and price in the market. In general, higher yields are offered with longer periods of maturity. This is important for investors to pay attention to.”

“Now that we know what bonds are and some of the important things to know about bonds, it is time to learn about the different types of bonds. A common type of bond is a Corporate Bond. Corporate Bonds are issued by companies for various purposes, such as expansion or research. There are also municipal bonds. Local governments issue Municipal Bonds to fund things like road renovations or schools. Government Bonds on the other hand are issued by National Governments. In general, these types of bonds are more secure.” 

“High-yield bonds, also known as “Junk Bonds” are not considered safe due to their higher risks of defaulting. They are issued by companies with lower credit ratings, meaning the issuers are more likely to default. To compensate for this risk, these bonds offer a higher interest rate.”

##Slide 9
“Another type of Bond is a Zero Coupon Bond. These bonds are unique because they do not pay interest on the principal like other bonds. Instead, they are sold at a discount of their face value. This means that you would buy a bond at $800 and then at maturity it would be worth $1000. Your return is the difference between what you pay and what the bond is worth at maturity. These bonds are attractive to investors because they have predictable returns, although they are less liquid due to the absence of interest payments.” 

##Slide 10
“Since there are many types of bonds, it is important to know that the many types interact with taxes differently. Taxable bonds are subject to federal, state, and local taxes. With that, there are some exemptions. Municipal Bonds are exempt from the federal income tax and U.S. Treasury Bonds are exempt from state and local income taxes. On the other hand, corporate bonds are subject to all taxes.”

“With investment comes risks, investing in bonds being no different. There are two main risks: interest rates and credit or defaulting. The interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the value of a bond. When interest rates rise, the value of a bond typically decreases due to newer bonds offering higher yields. This happens because there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. The duration of a bond largely affects the level of interest rate risk. Longer duration bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes, therefore they incur higher risks. Credit risk, also known as defaulting risk refers to the risk that a bond issuer is unable to pay the interest and principal of a bond to the investor. To assess this risk, investors can look at the credit rating of the bond issuer. Credit rating agencies can determine creditworthiness based on the issuer's ability to pay debt obligations. Bonds with higher credit ratings typically offer lower yields because they are considered safe.”
