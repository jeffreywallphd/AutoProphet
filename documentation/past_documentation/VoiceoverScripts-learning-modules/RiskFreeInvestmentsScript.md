##Slide 2 Risk Free Investments Intro
Voiceover: “In this module you will learn the basics of risk free investments, including information about what they are, why types there are and what each type does, and how safe they are.” 

##Slide 3 What are Risk Free Investments?
Voiceover: “Risk free investments are investments that have a certain future return value, usually with little to no possibility of a loss. There are some that are even backed by the U.S. government. Because these types of investments are so safe, the returns on them are usually very close to the current interest rate.” 

##Slide 4 What types are there? 
Voiceover: “In this module, you will learn about the different types of risk free investments. Some types of risk free investments include: Savings accounts, Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, Money Markets, and Certificates of Deposit.” 

##Slide 5 What does each type do? (Savings accounts)
Voiceover: “Savings accounts are pretty generic bank accounts that gain interest over time. You can withdraw money and have access to your money at any time. This kind of account is subject to a $250,000 insurance from the FDIC. Banks often pay very low interest on these types of accounts, usually around 1%-2%. Savings accounts have a big benefit over checking accounts as they offer the same level of liquidity, but also pays interest. There are some limits depending on the bank on how often you can transfer money from a savings account per month. 

##Slide 6 What does each type do? (Treasury Bills) 
Voiceover: “Treasury bills are government issued debt obligations backed by the treasury department. These securities are sold at a price that is below face value, which then results in a profit at its maturity date. An example of this could be that for a Treasury bill with a face value of $10,000 and a maturity date of 52-weeks, the price could be $9,700 so that there is a $300 interest income at its maturity date, which is a yield of 3.1% that year. There are 2 major benefits with Treasury bills. 1st, Is their lack of risk, as they are backed by the federal government. 2nd, is the tax benefits from it. Treasury bills are taxable at the federal level, but exempt at the state and local levels. These investments may not make sense for individuals that are seeking the best long term growth possible, but for individuals that value stability, treasury bills are about as safe as you can get. 

##Slide 7 What does each type do? (Treasury Bonds) 
Voiceover: “Treasury bonds are very similar to Treasury bills, with the main difference being the maturity date for each bond. Treasury bonds usually can have a maturity range from 10-30 years, where 30 is the most common. Usually interest is paid out every 6 months. Similar to Treasury bills, Treasury bonds are tax free at the state level, but are taxable at the federal level. You can purchase Treasury bonds straight from the U.S. Treasury, or through participating banks and brokers. The bonds are sold at an auction that sets the price and yield of the bond. 

##Slide 8 What does each type do? (Money Markets)
Voiceover: “Money Markets are liquid investments that are suited for the small investor. They traditionally invest in Treasury funds and commercial paper. They are pretty similar to savings accounts, but you do have to have a minimum balance to open one, and you also need to keep a minimum balance too. The money has to be kept in the money market for a set amount of time, however you can take out your money after that period of time, but before the full maturity date to get a percent of the profit. Money market funds are short term, so funds are usually invested in a limited period of time. They also boast a low interest rate, but often are still higher than most savings accounts, and money markets are often better suited for the short term investor. 

##Slide 9 What does each type do? (Certificate of Deposit)
Voiceover: “Certificates of Deposit are often sold by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. They are a type of savings account that pays a fixed interest rate on money help for an agreed upon period of time. The big difference between Certificates of Deposit and savings accounts is that with Certificates of Deposit, you can’t access or use the money without facing a penalty. To counteract this, usually Certificates of Deposit usually have a higher interest rate than most savings accounts do. 

##Slide 10 How safe are they? 
Voiceover: “Risk free investments are usually very safe. Most of them are insured by the FDIC, and others are backed by the U.S. Treasury. While technically there are no investments that are truly 100% safe, risk free investments like FDIC-insured savings accounts, Money Market funds, Treasury bills and bonds are all generally accepted to be very safe investments.”
