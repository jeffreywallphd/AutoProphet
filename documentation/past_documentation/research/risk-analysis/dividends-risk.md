# Dividend-Specific Risks

    - One of the biggest risks dividend investors encounter are what are called dividend traps. In general, a dividend value trap occurs when a very high dividend yield attracts investors to a potentially troubled company. To spot these traps, investors should look for the following warning signs:
        -- High payout ratios
        -- Falling cash flow growth
        -- Limited cash
        -- Large debt burdens
        -- Layoffs
        -- Earnings misses
        -- Reduced guidance and estimates
        -- General industry softness

## The Risks to Dividends
    - During the financial meltdown in 2008-2009, almost all of the major banks either slashed or eliminated their dividend payouts. These companies were known for consistent, stable dividend payouts each quarter for literally hundreds of years. Despite their storied histories, many dividends were cut.
    - In other words, dividends are not guaranteed and are subject to macroeconomic as well as company-specific risks. Another potential downside to investing in dividend-paying stocks is that companies that pay dividends are not usually high-growth leaders.
