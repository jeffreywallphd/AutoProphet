## Education-Finance Research 

# Research Topic #1:General Finance and Investing Information

## What is a stock and what happens when you invest 
Represent ownership of a company: signifies a claim on a portion of the company's assets in a company  
- Essentially buying shares of ownership in a company  
- When you buy stock, you become a **shareholder**  
- Number of shares you own determines your ownership stake  
- In liquidation (if a company declares bankruptcy), common stockholders get whatever assets remain after creditors, bondholders, and preferred stockholders are paid
- investing comes with risks!

## Value
Value can fluctuate based on various factors: 
- company performance
- Industry trends
- Economic conditions
- Etc

## Dividends 
- Some Companies distribute  a portion of their earnings/profits to shareholders in the form of **dividends**
- Typically, paid out of a company’s earnings 
- Not all stocks pay dividends, and a company’s board of directors decides whether to distribute them or not

## Buying and Selling Stocks 

### Capital Gains and Losses
- When you sell a stock for a pricer higher than you paid for it, you realize a capital gain 
- If you sell a stock for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss

### Long-Term Growth 
- Investors often buy stocks to hold for long periods of time, hoping to benefit from the potential growth of the companies they invest in
- Stocks are bought and sold by traders/investors on **stock exchanges**
- Investors can purchase stocks through brokerage accounts
- Price of a stock can be influenced by supply and demand within the market:
- More supply, less demand- lower prices
- Less supply, higher demand- higher prices
-Stock Exchange Examples: 
- Nasdaq
- New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
- London Stock Exchange
- Tokyo Stock Exchange
-Large US-based stocks are traded on a public exchange 

### Difference between Stock Market and Stock Exchange
- Stock exchanges are specific locations where brokers and traders buy/sell securities 
- Stock market has a wider scope, as it includes a wide variety of stock exchanges

## Types of Stocks 

### Common Stocks
- Primarily a form of ownership in the corporation, representing a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings

### Preferred Stock
- Distinct class of stocks that provides different rights compared to common stock
- Higher claim to a company’s assets and dividends than common stockholders

## Key Differences between preferred and common stock:

### Voting Rights
- Common stock-holders have voting rights in the company and can participate in decisions about corporate policies and elections of the board of directors
- Preferred stock - either no voting rights or limited voting rights (depending on the specific share terms)

### Dividends
- Common stock - not guaranteed 
- paid out of company’s profit at the decision of a company’s board of directors 
- Paid after preferred stock dividends
- Preferred stock - fixed dividend rate
- Paid before common stockholders

### Liquidation
- Common Stock - last in line to claim any assets
- Preferred Stock - higher claim on assets and are paid out before common stockholders

### Convertibility
- Common Stock - not convertible into any other types of securities
- Preferred Stock - may be converted into common shares based on terms 

### Risk and Return (Volitability)
- Common Stock 
 potential for higher returns through through capital appreciation and dividends, BUT
- Higher risks due to price volatility
- Value influenced by market forces, company performance, etc. 

### Preferred Stock 
- Have a more stable income stream (“safer”) due to fixed dividends, BUT
- May not benefit from company growth as much 
- Although preferred stock has less risk and a greater claim on assets, common stock (although more risky) usually outperform both bonds and preferred stock in the long run

### How to Invest in Common Stock
- Important part of an investors portfolio
- High risks, but higher rewards
- Can choose from different kinds of common stock
- Growth stocks - belongs to companies expected to increasing earnings
- Value stocks - priced relatively lower and often pay dividends
- Classified by market capitalization
- Large-cap Stocks - more frequently traded; represent well-established and stable companies
- Small-cap Stocks - often belong to newer, growth-oriented firms; tend to be more volatile 

### How to Invest in Preferred Stock
- Can trade just like common stock, however…
- Investors need a different approach when investing
- Researching issuing company is very important, can be just as risky as common stock if the company is shaky
- Key thing to consider is the DIVIDEND
- Compare the dividends you can receive relative to the share price to determine if the yield offers an attractive return 
- Take notes on whether the stock is callable or convertible
- Callable - can be repurchased by the issuer (the corporation) at a preset date and price, causing you to miss out on future dividends
- Convertible - can be converted into common stock, which can be advantageous if the price of common stock rises significantly 

### Stock Options 
- Gives an investor the right (but not obligation) to buy or sell a stock at an agreed-upon price and date
- Agreed-upon price is called the strike price
- Type of financial instrument known as a DERIVATIVE
- Means their worth is based on the value of an underlying asset - in this case, shares of a company’s stock 
- Often used as a compensation for employees or an investment tool for traders 
- Two types of options
- Puts - a bet that a stock will fall
- Afford the holder the right to sell the stock at a stated price and specific time
- Investors will usually buy put options when they expect the price of the stock to fall in the future. 
- If it does so, they can then sell the stock at the higher strike price
- Calls - a bet that a stock will rise 
- Afford the holder the right to buy the stock at a stated price and specific time
- Investors will usually buy when they expect the price of the stock to rise in the future.
 - If it does so, the call option holder (or investor) can exercise the option and buy the stock at a lower price 

### Return: refers to gain or loss made on an investment over a certain period 
-A measure of the profitability of an investment, expresses as a percentage of the initial investment amount
- Different types of returns:
- Return on Investment (ROI) - represents the percentage increase or decrease in the value of an investment relative to to the initial amount invested 
- Positive ROI = profit, Negative ROI = loss
- Total Return -  considers not only the change in value of the investment but also includes any income generated from dividends/interest
- Total Return = Capital Gain/Loss + Dividends/Interest
- Dividend Yield - annual dividend income as a percentage of the current market price of the stock
- Capital Gains Yield - represents the percentage change in the market price of a stock 
- Risk-Adjusted Return 
- Adjusts the return for the level of risk associated with an investment
- Common measures: Sharpe ratio, risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)

## Crypto
- On the blockchain
- Many different cryptos with different things that they are tied to
- NFTs also tied to blockchain
- Like digital pieces of art
- Many brokerages offer options to buy or swap crypto assets

# Research Topic #2: Index Funds, Mutual Funds
- "Easter basket” of stocks
- Mutual funds are entities that can be invested in that own shares in a variety of different companies according to a set of stated investment goals and guidelines.
- Your money goes in, you get a corresponding number of shares in the fund, and the manager of the fund uses the money you gave them to invest further.
- Index funds are a type of mutual fund.
- Run by a large company
- Typically run by investment firms such as Fidelity, as would need a lot of money to start one of these funds.
- Track the market
- Index funds tie their value to the market.
- They pick an index to tie themselves to, then automatically adjust their portfolio to mirror that index.

# Research Topic #3:Risk-free Investments 
- CD’s, savings accounts, t-bills/t-bonds, money market
- CD’s: certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of savings account that can earn interest at a fixed rate that's usually higher than traditional savings accounts. (limited usually to $250,000 as it is FDIC-insured only to that value) You can face a penalty if you were to withdraw the funds before the term expires. 
- Savings accounts are pretty generic bank accounts that can gain interest, and you can withdraw and have access to the money whenever you want. Also subject to the $250,000 insurance from the FDIC. 
- Treasury bills and treasury bonds: T-bill is a government issued debt obligation backed by the treasury department. Usually the bills are issued for a length of 1 year or shorter. Fairly safe in that they are backed by the federal government, and they are useful in that the final value is only taxable at the federal level, but not state or local level. T-Bonds are similar to T-bills, but are longer lasting ranging from 10-30 years. Interest gets paid out every 6 months. Same tax rates apply as T-bills. Also can mention the T-note which sits as an inbetween from the T-bill and the T-bond. Usually T-notes are between 1-10 years for maturity, and interest is paid out every 6 months until maturity date. Same tax rates as T-bills. should be something to mention that all 3 of these are subject to inflation, and 
usually have a lower interest rate than other corporate securities. 
- Money markets: Relatively short term, about 1 year or less. Usually invested in treasury securities or commercial paper. Pretty similar to a savings account, but you do have to have a minimum balance to open it/keep it at, and you have to keep your money in the account for a set amount of time. Usually don't yield a huge return, they do have a higher interest rate than most savings accounts. More convenient for short term investors. 
- Can do at a local bank
- Not really trading
- cd’s/tbills will hold your money
- Money market/savings are liquid (low return)

# Research Topic #4: Bonds

## Bond Investment Basics

### Definition
Units of debt issued by companies/governments that are converted into tradable assets. A loan taken out by companies from investors where the company pays the investor an interest coupon (aka nominal yield) in exchange for the investor's capital. Bonds are usually very expensive, but retail investors can purchase bond indexes. The company pays interest coupons on predetermined intervals (monthly, annually, semiannually), and the principal is returned on the maturity date, ending the loan.

### Types
- **Corporate Bonds:** Issued by companies to pay expenses and raise capital. "Junk Bonds" are risky but offer the highest return. Corporate bonds are subject to BOTH federal and local income tax.
- **Sovereign/Government Bonds:** Issued by national governments. Governments are unlikely to default, so their credit rating is high, and there is a relatively low yield. In the US, they are called Treasuries, and in the UK, they are called Gilts. Exempt from state and local taxes, but NOT federal income tax.
- **Municipal Bonds:** Issued by states and municipalities, including state and county debt. Not subject to most taxes.
- **Agency Bonds:** Issued by government-affiliated organizations.

### Vocabulary
- **Maturity:** When the principal/par amount of the bond is paid to the investor, the lifetime of the bond.
- **Short-term:** 1-3 years
- **Medium-term:** 4-10 years
- **Long-term:** Over 10 years
- **Secured/Unsecured:**
  - **Secured:** Has collateral if the company cannot repay obligations.
  - **Unsecured:** Also known as debentures, no collateral, much riskier.
- **Callability:** Can be paid off by the company before maturity, usually at a slightly higher rate than par.

### Risks
- **Interest Rate Risk:** Bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates - when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The longer a bond takes to mature, the higher the interest rate risk.
- **Credit/Default Risk:** The risk that interest and principal payments on a bond won’t be made by the company. Typically, the higher the company operating income, the safer the bond.

### Bond Yields
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM):** Measures return on a bond if held to maturity.
- **Current Yield:** Bonds annual coupon/bonds current price, compares interest income provided by a bond vs. dividend income provided by stock.
- **Nominal Yield:** The percentage of interest to be paid on the bond periodically = annual coupon payment/face value of the bond.
- **Yield to Call (YTC):** Determines whether the prepayment risk is worthwhile on bonds.
- **Realized Yield:** Calculate when not planning on holding the bond until maturity.

### Special Types
- **Zero Coupon Bonds:** Bonds with no coupon, only par value at maturity, sold at a discount from face value.
- **Convertible Bonds:** Hybrid security that combines properties of bonds and stocks. Fixed-income bonds that can be converted to stock in the issuing company.

# Research Topic #5: Stocks Screening
...# Benchmarking
Benchmarking involves comparing your investment portfolio to something like the S&P 1500 or 500 or another benchmark with a similar risk tolerance. It's a higher-level tactic but important to know about when screening investments because it helps you understand what to look for.

### What to Look For Based on Risk Tolerance

When benchmarking, consider factors such as increasing revenue, high earnings per share, high return on investment (ROI), and various other performance measures. Risk increases when you have a shorter investment horizon or engage in active trading. Shorting the market with leverage while day trading is particularly risky and could result in significant losses.

### Risk Tolerance
Investors have different risk tolerances based on their preferences and time horizon. Here's a breakdown:
- **Low Risk:** Typically involves investing in indexes or risk-free assets.
- **Mid Risk:** Includes a mix of indexes and some individual stocks.
- **High Risk:** Involves more speculative trading strategies.

### Beta
Beta is a measure of how closely your investment tracks with the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates a perfect correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and values higher than 1 indicate a higher correlation with the market. Understanding beta helps manage price volatility based on your investment approach.

### Long-Term Investing
It's essential to remember that stocks will fluctuate over time, so it's wise to invest for the long run. Most investors view investments as a long-term strategy for saving and growing their money, minimizing the focus on short-term fluctuations.

### Retirement Accounts and Taxes
Consider utilizing Roth IRAs or IRAs for retirement savings to benefit from tax advantages, but remember that the choice depends on the individual investor's financial goals and situation.

### Company Bankruptcy
Investors should be aware of the risk of company bankruptcy, especially when holding common stock. In the event of bankruptcy, common stockholders may lose their entire investment.

### Short Selling and Leverage
Short selling involves selling shares you don’t currently own, betting that the market will decline. This strategy carries unlimited downside risk, as the market could continue to rise, resulting in substantial losses. Leverage can amplify returns but also increases the potential for significant losses if not managed properly.

# Research Topic #6: Taxes
# Taxes on Investments

When you buy a stock, you don't pay taxes immediately. Taxes come into play when you sell the investment. Here's an overview:

## Buy/Sell Strategy
The general strategy is to buy low and sell high, aiming to make a profit.

## Capital Gains Tax

### Long-Term Capital Gains (Asset Held Longer Than 1 Year)
- Capital gains taxes are due only after an investment is sold.
- Applied to capital assets such as stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, jewelry, coin collections, and real estate.
- If you earn a profit from selling an asset held for more than a year, you'll incur long-term capital gains tax.
  - Tax rates for long-term capital gains vary based on taxable income:
    - 0%
    - 15%
    - 20%

### Short-Term Capital Gains (Asset Held Shorter Than 1 Year)
- Occurs when you sell assets owned for one year or less.
- Taxed using ordinary income tax rates, depending on taxable income:
  - 10%
  - 12%
  - 22%
  - 24%
  - 32%
  - 35%
  - 37%

## Research for Investments
Most investors, based on their risk tolerance, opt for buying indexes rather than individual stocks. Index investing allows for diversified exposure to various companies, reducing individual stock risk.
