# OpenFinAL Style Guide
The following style guide should be used when updating the user interface. Changes to styling should be documented here BEFORE implementing style changes in the code.

## Main Content Areas
Main Content Areas are referring to the main focus of the page (not including the navigation).
- Whitespace should be reduced but not eliminated
    - Try to cover as much of the main content area as possible without making the page feel crowded
- Keep design consistent throughout ALL main content areas. Every area should look like it belongs in the app
- Graphics like graphs, symbols, pictures, etc... should follow the color pallet

## Navigation
- The navigation is to be left justified horizontally	
- The navigation menu will be collapsable with a button that will remain in the top left of the application regardless of the state of the navigation
- Each item in the navigation menu with child pages will have a dropdown arrow which will show all child pages when toggled
- The arrows are only to be shown when the navigation menu is uncollapsed

## Color Palette
The color palette depicted below is to be the exclusive color palette used in the AutoProfit program.
