# News Page Documentation 

## Idea: 
The initial idea was to create a News page to incorporate breaking ideas in the financial industry that could prove useful to investors and their financial decisions. We wanted it to be a platform for the most information-rich articles and a place for the user to track what they care about.

## Design Process: 
When creating the News page we decided to list multiple articles with a brief summary to list the key ideas that will be discussed in the article. With each article, the decision to include how many minutes each read felt like a good idea for investors and financial professionals with limited time. In addition to this, labels were included and given to each article for readers to know if it is about trading for example, or maybe investing. For each article we wanted the user to be able to save/favorite the author or the company. We wanted it to work and look similar to an email, once you favorite something it will be on the left bar of the screen that the user can then look easily at to find what they are looking for. 

Having a Twitter feed on the side of the page was a thought to include tweets from financial professionals or other investors to help the readers make more informed decisions. 
An idea that was discussed was having a live ticker that is across the the top of the screen to show stock prices and if they are up or down on the day. The other thought was to also include this on every other page of the website.
