## Introduction

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, configuring, and using *OpenFinAL*. It is organized by features and topics rather than teams, so you can easily locate information relevant to specific areas of the project. Each feature has its own dedicated folder, and each folder is organized with the same format to ensure consistency across the entire documentation.
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Each major feature has its own dedicated folder, allowing for focused, easy-to-navigate content.
- **Consistency**: Documentation across the project follows a standardized template to ensure uniformity and coherence.

## How to Use This Documentation

### 1. **Navigating Folders**

The documentation repository is organized into high-level directories for easy access:

- **`documentation/`**: Core documentation applicable across all features.
- **`documentation/past_documentation/`**: Archived content and old documentation versions.
- **`documentation/[Feature Name]/`**: Feature-specific documentation for detailed implementation and usage instructions.
- **`documentation/other/`**: Additional resources such as tools, FAQs, or external references.

### 2. **Readme Files in Each Subfolder**

Each subfolder contains a `README.md` file that serves as an introduction to that specific section or feature. These files typically include:

- An overview of the feature or topic.
- Links to detailed documentation files for deeper understanding.
- A table of contents to guide you through the available documentation in that area.

Refer to these README files to get started quickly and navigate the content efficiently.

## Maintaining Documentation

### Process for Updating Documentation

As the project evolves, it is essential to keep the documentation accurate and up to date. Follow these best practices to maintain the quality and relevance of the documentation:

### 1. **Identify the Need for Updates**

- **Regular Review**: Periodically review the existing documentation to identify outdated information, missing content, or new features.
- **Feedback**: Collect feedback from team members, users, and stakeholders on areas that may require clarification or expansion.
- **Track Project Changes**: Monitor release notes, commits, and other project updates to ensure documentation aligns with the latest changes.

### 2. **Create a Local Copy**

- Clone the latest version of the documentation repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your changes, following the version control guidelines and naming conventions.

### 3. **Make Necessary Edits**

- Navigate to the relevant section or feature folder.
- Edit the content to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
- Update code examples, images, and references as needed.

### 4. **Update Related Sections**

If the changes impact other areas (e.g., configuration changes, API updates), ensure those sections are updated as well.

### 5. **Preview Your Changes**

- Preview your changes locally to verify proper formatting and readability.
- Check for broken links or missing references using tools like [Markdown link checker](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://markdownlivepreview.com/&ved=2ahUKEwivnuehxsOLAxX7j4kEHQWBAJUQFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0v5A3n1tQURK4jbeN4UnkA).

### 6. **Submit for Review**

Once changes are made, submit a pull request (PR) following the project’s contribution guidelines.

## Best Practices for Writing Documentation

### 1. **Clarity and Conciseness**

- Aim for clear, easy-to-understand language.
- Avoid jargon unless it is well-defined within the context of the project.
- Be concise—users should be able to quickly grasp the necessary information.

### 2. **Consistent Formatting**

- Use headings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break content into digestible chunks.
- Keep code examples consistent in style, indentation, and formatting.
- Use hyperlinks to connect related topics or external resources.

### 3. **Regular Updates**

- Documentation should be updated with every change in the project.
- Review the documentation regularly to ensure it reflects the current state of the project.
