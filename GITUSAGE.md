User Manual for Pushing Changes to `FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#` Branch on GitHub

0. Introduction to GitHub
GitHub is a platform that allows teams to collaborate on coding projects. It uses Git, a version control system, which helps you manage changes in your project over time.

With GitHub, you can:
- Work together on projects with others.
- Track changes made to your code.
- Collaborate using branches, which are separate versions of your project.
- Push or upload your changes from your local computer to GitHub.

This guide will walk you through the steps to push your code changes to the `FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#` branch.

1. Setting Up Git on Your Computer
Step 1: Install Git
If you don’t have Git installed:
- Windows: Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it.
- macOS: Open Terminal and type `git`. If Git is not installed, you'll be prompted to install it.
- Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`.

Step 2: Configure Git
After installing Git, configure your username and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

2. Cloning the Repository
Step 1: Open Terminal or Command Prompt
Use the command line to interact with Git. If you’re using:
- Windows: Open Command Prompt or Git Bash.
- macOS/Linux: Open Terminal.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
To start working on a project, you need to clone (download) the project from GitHub to your computer. Use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/OpenFinAL.git
```

4. Protecting Your Email Privacy on GitHub

When you contribute to projects on GitHub, you might not want to expose your personal email in commit logs. GitHub offers a private email option to keep your personal email address private. Here's how you can set this up:

Step 1: Find Your GitHub Private Email
i. Go to your GitHub profile.
ii. Click on **Settings**.
iii. In the sidebar, click on **Emails**.
iv. Under the "Email Settings", you'll find a private email address that looks like `ID+username@users.noreply.github.com`. This is the email you can use to obscure your personal email.

Step 2: Setting Up Git to Use Your GitHub Private Email
i. Open your terminal or command prompt.
ii. Set your email globally for all repositories on your machine:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "ID+username@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```
   Alternatively, you can set it for a single repository by navigating to the repository directory and running:
   ```
   git config user.email "ID+username@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```

### Step 3: Confirming Your Email Settings
i. To check if your email has been set correctly in Git, you can use:
   ```
   git config user.email
   ```
   This command will display the email currently set for your Git commits.

By following these steps, you can contribute to projects without exposing your personal email address in commit logs.

5. Committing and Pushing Changes to GitHub
Once your changes are done, you need to save them to the GitHub repository by following these steps:

Step 1: Stage Your Changes
Before committing, you need to stage the changes. This means telling Git which files you want to include. Run:
```bash
git pull
git add .
```
First command fetches current changes on the branch so that you have what others have pushed.
second command stages all changed files. If you want to add a specific file, replace the `.` with the file path (e.g., `git add filename.py`).

Step 2: Commit Your Changes
After staging, commit the changes with a message describing what you did:
```bash
git commit -m "Added feature X or fixed bug Y"
```

Step 3: Push Your Changes
To send your changes to GitHub, use the push command:
```bash
git push origin FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#
```
This uploads the changes to the `FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#` branch on GitHub.

6. Pulling Changes from GitHub
Before you start working on new changes, it’s a good practice to pull the latest changes from the repository to make sure you're working on the most recent version of the project.

Use this command to pull updates:
```bash
git pull origin FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#
```

7. Common Git Commands Cheat Sheet
Here are some common commands you’ll use while working with Git:

|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `git clone <repository-url>`        | Download a GitHub repository to your local machine |
| `git checkout <branch-name>`        | Switch to a branch                                 |
| `git add <file>` or `git add .`     | Stage changes (add files to the commit)            |
| `git commit -m "message"`           | Commit your changes with a message                 |
| `git push origin <branch-name>`     | Push your changes to GitHub                        |
| `git pull origin <branch-name>`     | Pull the latest changes from GitHub                |
| `git status`                        | Check the current status of your files             |

8. Troubleshooting
- "Permission denied" errors: If you encounter permission issues while pushing changes, you might need to set up SSH keys or authenticate using a personal access token. Refer to GitHub's documentation for guidance.
- Merge conflicts: Sometimes you might encounter a merge conflict when pushing or pulling. This happens if there are conflicting changes. Git will notify you, and you’ll need to resolve the conflict by choosing which changes to keep.


9. Conclusion
Now you’re ready to push your changes to the `FALL2024-BA5200-TEAM#` branch on GitHub! With GitHub and Git, you can easily collaborate with our team, track progress, and manage code changes efficiently.
