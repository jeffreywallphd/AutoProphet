# Best Coding Practices

## Definition of Coding:
1. The process of assigning a code to something for classification or identification.
2. The process or activity of writing computer programs.

We aim to teach a coding mindset that complements technical expertise by providing clear guidelines tailored to complex real-world problems.

### High-level Goals:
1. Solve a specific problem.
2. Ensure code is easy to read and understand.
3. Make code maintainable and extendable.

### Writing Code:
- **Always Solve a Specific Problem:**
  - Avoid attempting to create overly generic solutions.
  - Articulate a clear description of the problem before coding.
  - Start documentation or README with a problem description.
  
- **Write Readable Code:**
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Avoid hard coding and aim for flexibility.
  - Reference existing CSS files for styling that aligns with UI documentation guidelines.
  - Reuse classes to maintain consistency in styling across the application.
  
- **Coding Convention:**
  - Variables and functions should reflect their purpose.
  - Hard coding should be minimized or avoided.
  - Consistent coding style enhances readability and understanding.
  
### Comments and Documentation:
- Comments explain non-obvious rationale.
- Documentation should cover problem description, methodology, and references.
- Provide clear instructions on navigating the code.

### Maintainability and Extensibility:
- Reduce code duplication and enhance code reuse.
- Modularize code organization.
- Limit variable scope and use configuration files for dynamic execution.
- Utilize automated testing for quality assurance.

### File Structure:
- Organize files and data for repeatability and ease of revisiting.
- Establish a clear, consistent, and descriptive file structure.
- Consider collaborators and future reproducibility.

### Naming Conventions:
- Be descriptive and concise.
- Avoid ambiguity, especially in versioning.
- Utilize context and delimiters effectively.

### Coding and Comment Style:
- Use clear and consistent naming, structuring, and context.
- Follow spacing conventions for readability.
- Use comments sparingly, focusing on providing valuable context.

By adhering to these practices, we ensure code clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility, benefiting both current and future collaborators.
